Deep Learning Real-Time Recognition System

**Overview**

A deep learning based real-time American hand gesture recognition system. This system processes a single frame to detect and recognize alphabets A-Z, as well as 2 additional gestures: "space" and "delete".

**Features**

Real-time detection and recognition
Support for webcam inputs
Pre-trained models for recognizing
User-friendly visualization of detection results

**Demo**
